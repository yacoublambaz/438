Dear Dr Ali,

To run the program:
1. in C://www, create a new folder called lab2
2. Place all contents of this file in lab2
So, lab 2 would look like:
lab2/create.php
lab2/delete.php
etc...

3. To create the database, go to localhost/create.php
4. To start off, go to localhost/display.php, and the
interface contains create, read, update, and delete features

To create a contact, click on "Create Contact"
To update a contact, click on edit
to delete a contact, click on delete
